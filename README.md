>âš¡ **Fun fact:**
>>Did you know that honey never spoils? This is because honey has natural [preservatives](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/preservatives) and a low water content, making it an [inhospitable](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/inhospitable) environment for bacteria and microorganisms. So, technically, honey is one of the few foods that can last forever!
